absorbing foots and an alternative casing for the ramps card/control display




in my setup having the controler on top of the printer is not practical, and i have trouble inserting/extracting the card from the controler, also the display is not very readable in that position, the whole cable mess i left when building this printer was 
not aided by having to thread everything to the top of the printer
